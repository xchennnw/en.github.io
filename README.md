### Monte Carlo path tracing renderer based on C++ and OpenGL                                                     
This project uses C++ and OpenGL to implement a Monte Carlo path tracing renderer. The algorithm is implemented in shaders to enable GPU acceleration. It includes intersection calculations between rays and scenes using BVH, Monte Carlo path tracing algorithms, lighting and BRDF multiple importance sampling, and various materials such as diffuse, specular, glass, transmission, and microfacet models.

### Mini Minecraft                                                                             
We worked in team of 3 to imitate the scene generation and basic gameplay of Minecraft using C++ and OpenGL. Features include rendering and texturing of blocks, rendering and control of the player (including switching between first-person and third-person views, animation, and gliding functionality), physical simulation and collision detection of the player, procedural generation of multiple surface terrain and biomes, underground caves, rivers, water surface shader and underwater post-process, block addition and removal functionality, and rendering and control of NPCs.

### C++ Rasterization renderer                                                                    This project uses C++ to implement a CPU-based rasterization renderer. It includes the reading of model files in JSON format, a camera that can be controlled in terms of position and rotation, triangulation, transformation from world space to screen space, line-by-line triangle intersection testing, barycentric coordinate interpolation, z-buffering, and MSAA anti-aliasing.

### OpenGL Mini mesh editor                                                                   
This project uses OpenGL and C++ to implement a basic mesh editor. The project reads files in Obj and Json formats, builds models structured around vertices, faces, and half-edges, and skeletons structured around joints. Features include selection of points, lines, and faces, changing the position of vertices and the color of faces, global subdivision of model surfaces, linear blend skinning, and editing the position and rotation of joints.

## Some games
<br/>
### Unity3D implementation of the combat in Harry Potter: Magic Awaken   
Using Unity and C#，I implemented the combat gameplay in Harry Potter: Magic Awaken（with AI controlled opponent). I wrote the combat scene GUI, character controlling, the system of cards and magic points，and some spells including various kinds of attacking, healing, defense, friend cards, and summon animals.

### Unity3D platform shooting game 
The objective of the player is to reach the endpoint located at a high altitude. As the player kills enemies, the gravity will decrease, allowing them to jump higher. Enemies are dynamically generated based on the player's height, and each time they spawn, the gravity will be adjusted accordingly, so the player needs to keep attacking enemies in order to maintain their jumping height.

### UE5 two player battle game based on shadows     
The shadows of the player, the environment, weapons, and NPCs can all cause damage.
