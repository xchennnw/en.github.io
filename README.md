### Mini Minecraft                                                                             
We worked in team of 3 to imitate the scene generation and basic gameplay of Minecraft using C++ and OpenGL. Features include rendering and texturing of blocks, rendering and control of the player (including switching between first-person and third-person views, animation, and gliding functionality), physical simulation and collision detection of the player, procedural generation of multiple surface terrain and biomes, underground caves, rivers, water surface shader and underwater post-process, block addition and removal functionality, and rendering and control of NPCs.

### Unity3D implementation of the combat in Harry Potter: Magic Awaken   
Using Unity and C#，I implemented the combat gameplay in Harry Potter: Magic Awaken（with AI controlled opponent). I wrote the combat scene GUI, character controlling, the system of cards and magic points，and some spells including various kinds of attacking, healing, defense, friend cards, and summoning animals.

### Unity3D platform shooting game 
The objective of the player is to reach the endpoint located at a high altitude. As the player kills enemies, the gravity will decrease, allowing them to jump higher. Enemies are dynamically generated based on the player's height, and each time they spawn, the gravity will be adjusted accordingly, so the player needs to keep attacking enemies in order to maintain their jumping height.
